Hey hey, I'm Plamedi Luis, it's nice to meet you \
I'm an Electronic Engineer who enjoys breaking things to find out what makes them tick  \
When I'm not trying to re-implement the wheel, I'm typically exploring new developments in Tech.

I love playing games, making music, and breaking my linux config files in my spare time 
Don't be shy to reach out
